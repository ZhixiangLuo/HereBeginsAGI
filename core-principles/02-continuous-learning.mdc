# Continuous Learning and Improvement

Learning in HereBeginsAGI has three tracks:

1. **Fast iteration of execution documents** (keep plans/specs aligned with reality as you execute)
2. **Project diary** (project-only record keeping + future-impact callouts)
3. **Careful evolution of the core** (slow, evidence-based changes to the core rules)

## 1) Fast Iteration of Execution Documents (Living Documents)

Execution documents (product specs, plans, investigations) are *living*: they evolve from executing their own plan.

### Purpose
- Keep decisions aligned with reality, not stale assumptions.
- Make progress visible and reversible.
- Turn execution outcomes into reusable knowledge.

### Minimal structure (fast, lightweight)
Include these sections in any execution doc:

1. **Objective & success criteria** (what “done” means)
2. **Facts / Assumptions / Unknowns**
3. **Plan (small reversible steps)** + per-step verification
4. **Learning log** (what changed your plan and why)
5. **Updates** (what you changed in the doc as a result)

### Learning log format (fast iteration)
Each entry should be short and concrete:
- **Observation**: what happened (evidence)
- **Impact**: why it matters (success criteria affected?)
- **Decision**: what changed in the plan/doc
- **Next check**: what you will verify next

### Assumption lifecycle
All execution docs start with assumptions. As you execute:
- **Untested** → **Proven true/false** → **Superseded**

## 2) Project Diary (Project Record Keeping)

The project diary is a *chronological record* of work for the project. It supports:
- Recall (“what did we do, why, and how?”)
- Continuity (resume work after time away)
- Future impact (call out decisions/constraints/risks that may matter later)

### Where
- Repo-level: `project_diary.md`
- (Optionally) per-project diaries in the future if the repo grows

### When to write
- End of each work session, or after any meaningful decision/change.

### How to write (principle: low friction, not rigid)
Use chronological order (oldest first, newest at the bottom). Write like a lab notebook: prose is fine, bullets are fine, headings are optional.

Minimum recommendation:
- Start an entry with a timestamp heading: `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`
- Write enough so Future You can answer: **what happened, why, how, what changed, and what might matter later**.

Helpful (optional) prompts you can include when relevant:
- **What / why**: the decision or progress and the reasoning behind it
- **How**: approach taken, constraints, trade-offs
- **Changes**: key edits (link files/commands if helpful)
- **Verification**: what you checked (and outcome)
- **Future impact**: anything likely to matter later (risks, constraints, follow-up ideas)

Avoid using the diary as a task tracker. If you have next actions, track them in a real task system and optionally link it in the entry.

### Optional: how diary notes can inform the core
If you notice a recurring pattern that seems **general** (not project-specific), capture it as a candidate and evolve the core *slowly* (see section 3).

## 3) Slow, Careful Evolution of the Core

Core changes should be **rare and evidence-based**. The core must stay minimal and high-leverage.

### What counts as “core”
In this repo, the core is:
- `core-principles/01-problem-solving.mdc`
- `core-principles/02-continuous-learning.mdc`

### Core update criteria (guardrails)
Promote something into core only if:
- **Recurring**: it prevented or resolved multiple failures across sessions/tasks
- **General**: it applies across domains and problem types
- **Actionable**: it changes behavior (not just “be good”)
- **Testable**: you can tell if following it improved outcomes
- **Non-obvious**: it’s not something LLMs already do reliably

### “Minimal rules, maximum leverage”
Before adding a rule, ask:
- “Can this be derived from existing principles + base model knowledge?”
If yes, don’t add it.

### Safe core evolution loop
1. **Candidate**: write the proposed rule as a draft (in the diary first)
2. **Trial**: apply it for multiple sessions/tasks
3. **Evidence**: document concrete improvements (or failures) in the diary
4. **Integrate**: add/refine the core rule wording
5. **Stabilize**: keep it unchanged unless new evidence demands refinement

### What to do when rules conflict
Prefer:
- Clearer objective/success criteria
- Fewer steps (simplicity)
- Direct verification from the source of truth
If conflict persists, revise the wording so the trade-off is explicit.
